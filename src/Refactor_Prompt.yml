Objective and Scope:
  - I have a complex codebase that needs refactoring. Here's what I'd like your help with:

Refactoring Goals:

1. Code Organization:
   - Split device types from HE_DeviceCharacteristics.js into individual files
   - Place new the device type files in src/devices_types/ folder
   - Create a base class for all device types to extend
   - We don't need to create a complicated folder structure for this plugin so just use a flat folder structure with the exception of the devices_types folder
   - the devices_types folder should have a file for each device type in a flat folder structure
   

2. Create a HubitatAccessory Class Implementation:
   - Should contain common functions across device types:
     - handle all interactions the PlatformAccessory object called accessory
     - Accessory initialization
     - AccessoryInfo assignment 
     - getOrAddService
     - hasCapability
     - hasService
     - getCharacteristic
     - any Other shared utility functions necessary

3. Device Type Handling:
   - Move service/characteristic logic to individual device files
   - use the device type id as the file name 
   - Properly handle special services:
     - Buttons
     - Lights (including adaptive lighting)
   - Maintain service/characteristic cleanup logic.
   - handle each device type's specific logic in their respective files like the transforms, adaptive lighting, etc.

4. File Cleanup:
   - Eliminate HE_DeviceCharacteristics.js file
   - Eliminate Transforms file

5. Function Cleanup:
   - Eliminate manageGetCharacteristic
   - Eliminate manageGetSetCharacteristic


# 5. Resource usage optimizations:
#   - optimize memory and cpu resource consumption 
#    - Eliminate the use of global variables
#    - Eliminate the use of the Utils class

Output Expectations:
  - Step 1: Let's create a plan and outline the steps we need to take to refactor the code.
  - Step 2: Please provide the refactored code for the device types and any other necessary changes (one file at a time to avoid going over the response limit).
